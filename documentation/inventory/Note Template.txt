"Note"
{
    "Author" "Unknown" // The author of the note, not referenced to you as the creator but whoever wrote the note in the game, who sent this message, who had to write this up? Example, a character named Hans. = Author "Hans" because this was a note from Hans...
    "Texture" "Notes/myNote" // Path starts in materials/VGUI... Must be the filename of a .vmt file! The actual note image goes here, the text exported as an image in Photoshop, GiMP, etc...
    "Text" "This is a custom note, hello there..." // If you add this then it will override "Texture", in other words, you'll display a text box instead of an image, this will use the default note background image and this text will be in front of that image. Just like using a texture but easier for those who don't want to make new designed notes...
	"VoiceOver" "vo/Storyteller/example.wav" // Path starts in sound folder. This command allows you to enable speech during the note, a voice reading the note, etc... ( Must be a .wav file & if you don't intend to use voice over change this field to EMPTY )
