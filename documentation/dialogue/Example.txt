    "Option1" // Max 3 options! (Option2, Option3,,,) Each option has its own "outcome"...
	{
	    "Text" "Sure!" // Text to be displayed on the VGUI panel for this option.
	    "EntityToAffect" "worked_relay_1" // Entity to target/name of entity(targetname), using a trigger_relay is recommended as this one can trigger several things!
		"ActionOnEntity" "Trigger" // The action on the entity, trigger means trigger input on the trigger_relay!
		"ExitOnClick" "1" // Shall we exit the dialogue on clicking this option? Like "Goodbye...". Notice that if this option is 0 then you'll have to call the input on your tfo_dialogue_manager to re-show the dialogue after whatever you wanted to happen is done! (re-StartDialogueScene)...
		"OnlyOnce" "0" // If we can open this dialogue scene multiple times and we click something we only want to be clicked once, like retrieving something from the npc then set this to 1!
		"HasItem" "GoldenGlobe" // Make the dialogue option depend on this item, if the player doesn't have this item then this option will not be visible! The item must be a filename from the "inventory/items" folder! (This will not work for notes or maps)...
